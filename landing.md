			<h2> Deployment Dashboard</h2>
		</header>
		<p> In industry developers often face problem when testing team uses same database as developer team and data corruption occurs. To solve this problem, we developed a dashboard capable of doing automated continuous test build and deploy and continuously monitor the status of deployment. Here I learned about developing microservice architecture based ERP solutions and developed most of the skills necessary to be a full stack software developer.

					<h3>Car Damage Level Detector</h3>
				</header>
				<p>To automate manual inspection of Car in Car Insurance Companies Developed a module to detect level of damage in car from still car picture for a Car Insurance Company using Inception Net (A type of Neural Network). Here, I had learned lots of R&D and had hands on experience on Deep Learning and had hands on about Inception Neural Network Based Architecture</p>

					<h3>Text Summarizer</h3>
				</header>
				<p>It is often become very huge process for BU leads to get the insights of company from the feedback given by the members of the company. To encounter this problem, we developed a platform to extract insights of company from given feedback using clustering algorithms like LSA or LDA. Here I had hands on experience in Machine Learning.</p>

					<h3>AI based Document Parser</h3>
				</header>
				<p>To Automate Project Audit Process (Which is currently done manually) we developing a module which automates this whole process using Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning. Here I having a lot of hands on experience in these fields of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
