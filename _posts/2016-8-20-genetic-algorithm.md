# Travelling Salesman Problem solved with GA
**Scenario:**
Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns back to the starting point.<br>

In the following pictures we will see initial tour of points given in orange line
and optimized solution will be in orange line.i.e Our solution path should be as short as possible<br>


Genetic Algotithm is known as evalutionary algorithm. Typically for Travelling Salesman Problem
it takes O(n!) to solve for n cities. But in this algorithm we can have pretty good
optimization for 20 points. Brute force approach takes __~77 years__ to solve (NP-Compete). 

But Using Genetic Algorithm (GA) solves within __~20 seconds to 1 minutes.__
