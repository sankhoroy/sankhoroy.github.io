# Deep Learning

**Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. I am familiar with 
Tensorflow backend. *I prefer Keras for its simplicity and its usefulness in fast experimentation.*

**PyTorch** is an open source deep learning platform. I usually don't use pytorch if it is easier to do in Keras or Tensorflow.

# Machine Learning

**scikit-learn** is Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. I mainly use it for Machine learning related purpose.
*I prefer it due to lots of supports available as it is a popular library.* 

# Natural Language Processing
**NLTK** is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. I usually use it for NLP related tasks.

**Gensim** is a robust open-source vector space modeling and topic modeling toolkit implemented in Python. I usually use it for word-embedding related tasks.

# Front End

**Angular** is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application framework. I use it to devlop front end of web based software.

# Back End

**Flask** is a micro web framework in python. Usually all my Machine learning, Deep learning related codes are deployed in flask server.


**Spring Boot** is java based web framework. I use it to create java based back end for web softwares. 

# Devops

**Docker** is a tool used for hassle-free deployment in server. It can take care of enviornment of deployment.  

# Databases
**MySQL** is an open source relational database management system.

**Redis** is an open-source in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed,
 in-memory key-value database with optional durability.*I used REDIS DB for very fast retrival of word embeddings in NLP related tasks.*

**Mongo DB**  is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. 
    *I used MongoDB for such data where I needed more frequent data retrival than writting.*

**Neo4j** is a NoSQL graph database management system .*I used Neo4j whenever I found informations/ data's are linked with one another*

**Cassandra**  is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
