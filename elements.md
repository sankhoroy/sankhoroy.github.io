		<h3>Academic Works</h3>
		<p>
		In college I had done some projects in Machine Learning .e.g.
		<ul>
		<li> Character Recognition using Bayesian Model.</li>
		<li> Doing PCA of 200 facial images and finding eigenfaces using a space optimized algorithm named KL Transform.</li>
		<li> Clustering a RGB image using Gausian Mixture Model.</li>
		<li> Fine tuning parameters of a SVM model in a given dataset.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Indrustial Experience</h3>
		<p>In my career I had three months training of Java Full Stack Developer where we made a product <i>Deployment Dashboard.</i><br>
		After joining CGI I developed couple of module involving Deep Learning , Machine Learning related stuff. 
		<i> One thing I can say clearly from my indrustial experience that there is a significant difference between developing a code in college 
		and developing real time product in a company. Developing real product needs lots of practical idea than anything else. </i>

		<h3>Works in own interest</h3>
		<p>Besides doing as usual job I had done some interesting Works. In my workplace I have to study new concepts. 
		I tried to implement some cutting edge technologies in this field of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning,
		 Genetic algorithm, Deep Reinforcement Learning.<i>This concepts keeps me motivated in throughout my career.</i>
